# Pandemonium
Pandemonium is a music player aimed at playing multiple simultaneous streams. I wanted to overlay multiple tracks like rain, wind, chirping, and such, to block out background noise &amp; help me focus while coding.

It's not intended to be a sophisticated music player, but to serve a specific need I have, so it will probably always be a very niche project with a niche UX.

# Usage
Add files by dragging from Windows Explorer &amp; dropping onto the main file list.
Drag &amp; drop is currently the only way to add files to the playlist.
